# Portfolio-Hub
Purpose: A list of programs I've made in no particular order displaying my ability to program and do industry standard writeups<br><br>

# UNIX Shell üñ•Ô∏è: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/UNIX-shell<br><br>
-**Description:** A command-line shell interpreter made in C to run on UNIX operating systems<br>
-**Relevance:** This was a term-long class project where we had to develop on top of existing code to develop a functional UNIX shell. It was good for understanding system processes, working in grandfathered code bases, and problem solving in ways I hadn't needed to before this class. <br>

# Couchlist website üõãÔ∏è:
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Couchlist<br><br>
-**Description:** A website done up in HTML to resemble Craigslist but with a hidden story about a couch haunted by the ghost of the poster's grandfather. I used CSS to create style sheets between pages and then used JS to create page functions like the dropdown menu on the side of the page to help the user navigate up and down.<br>
-**Relevance:** Couchlist is my favorite demo project I did for web development in college. It tells a story but also displays an understanding of stylesheets, functions, communication between multiple languages.<br>

# Algorithms üßÆ: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Algorithms<br><br>
-**Description:** Some algorithms written in Python. Dijkstra, Travelling salesman, Top down/Bottom up algorithms<br>
-**Relevance:** Display my own background in Python and knowledge of some well-known and relevant algorithms.<br>

# Van Scheduler üöê:
https://github.com/charcoalrox/van-schedule-maker<br><br>
-**Description:** A Terminal-based interface that would import external .txt files and then allow users to log into an account and schedule van stops. Written in C and meant to simulate all necessary functions that would be required to get a terminal like this to work (from a minimum viable standpoint. There's no real security here). The repo also contains documentation like a UML diagram and test cases.<br>
-**Relevance:** This project is larger than the others with a lot of moving parts and functionality. I worked with the operating system and also python and a user interface to make something navigable and easy to understand. It also shows some documentation I have experience writing (UML diagrams and test cases).<br>

# Client-Server message encoder ü§ê: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Client-Server-Message-Encoder<br><br>
-**Description:** A series of C programs. The encoder and decoder are software that run on local servers and wait for users to ping them. The Users must provide a key (or key length for the encoder) and a message and the server can perform a handshake and perform their relevant task (encoding or decoding).<br>
-**Relevance:** Practice in computer networking and security. This code is meant to display an ability to interface with software and build something that can be safe against networking pitfalls like race conditions while performing it's task. Encoder keys are also a popular method of security right now making this a very relevant example of my experience.<br>

# My Pet Rock ü™®: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/My-Pet-Rock<br><br>
-**Description:** A C program that procedurally generates a text-based image of a pet rock and then saves user information for their rock's layout, name, and any stats they might have gained playing together. It's a Tomagachi game made intentionally boring and hard to play but it's still meant to be functional and help me learn some new tasks (random generation in this case).<br>
-**Relevance:** <br>

# Fishin' Hole üê†: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Fishin-Hole<br><br>
-**Description:** A fully functioning Gameboy ROM made using C and the GBDK 2020 libraries that sought to recreate the fictional game "Fishin' Hole" from Stephen King's book, End of Watch. Since it's a Stephen King-themed project I should give a **content warning** for references to suicide <br>
-**Relevance:** Solo development of a Gameboy rom requires a lot of pre-planning, user testing, and careful consideration. It's impossible to debug effectively without at least some knowledge of machine code and you have to know exactly what's going on to keep the ROM and RAM memory banks from overflowing. It's also very fun and I like showing this project off.<br>

# What I couldn't show here üò∂:
As a student a lot of my much larger projects are classwork that professors don't always let me upload on line since they're technically answers to assignments for future students. A lot of my bigger, cooler group projects aren't allowed to be made public but, rest assured I also have a lot of larger group assignments I work on in my free time including databases and large group HTML projects with unit tests. <br>
I hope to show that I've got a pool of knowledge in a lot of coding languages and good practices. Along with GDBK, I've also made projects in Game Maker, Unreal Engine, and Godot with plans to learn new engines once I wrap up my current project. I've worked in Python, HTML (and friends), C and C++ and I'll keep updating this repo when I've completed something big and cool enough to show off publically.<br>

# What I'm currently working on ‚úàÔ∏è: 
At the moment I'm working through school assignments. I'm on a year-long capstone project making vehicle simulations in Unreal Engine and Unity Engine (though I'm primarily working in Unreal). The goal is to make something realistic that works with modern racing wheels and libraries so that it's large and modular.<br>
I've been studying the flight behaviors of jet planes and recreating their movement and physics in a program from scratch and helping my group to do the same with a race car. I hope to eventually shar what I'm allowed to on this repository.

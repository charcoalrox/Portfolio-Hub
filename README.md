# Portfolio-Hub
Purpose: A hub that contains links and descriptions to some of my choice projects <br><br>

# UNIX Shell: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/UNIX-shell<br><br>
-**Description:** A command-line shell interpreter made in C to run on UNIX operating systems<br>
-**Relevance:** This was a term-long class project where we had to develop on top of existing code to develop a functional UNIX shell. As such, I don't think it displays any efficiency or organizational skills but that I'm capable of working in preexisting large code bases and completing a project. <br>

# Couchlist website:
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Couchlist<br><br>
-**Description:** A website done up to resemble Craigslist in HTML but with a hidden story about a couch haunted by the ghost of the poster's grandfather. I used CSS to create colors and a cohesive style sheet between pages and then used JS to create page functions like the dropdown menu on the side of the page to help the user navigate up and down.<br>
-**Relevance:** Couchlist is my favorite demo project I did for web development in college. It tells a story but also displays an understanding of stylesheets, functions, and all 3 languages. I wouldn't ship this website but It's enough to show that I could make a website.<br>

# Algorithms:
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Algorithms<br><br>
-**Description:** Some algorithms written in Python. Dijkstra, Travelling salesman, Top down/Bottom up algorithms<br>
-**Relevance:** Display my own background in Python and knwoledge of some well-known and relevant algorithms.<br>

# Van Scheduler:
https://github.com/charcoalrox/van-schedule-maker<br><br>
-**Description:** A Terminal-based interface that would import external .txt files and then allow users to log into an account and schedule van stops. Written in C and meant to simulate all necessary functions that would be required to get a terminal like this to work (from a minimum viable standpoint. There's no real security here). The repo also contains documentation like a UML diagram and test cases.<br>
-**Relevance:** This project is larger than the others with a lot of moving parts and functionality. I worked with the operating system and also python and a user interface to make something navigable and easy to understand. It also shows some documentation I have experience writing (UML diagrams and test cases).<br>

# Client-Server message encoder: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Client-Server-Message-Encoder<br><br>
-**Description:** A series of C programs. The encoder and decoder are software that run on local servers and wait for users to ping them. The Users must provide a key (or key length for the encoder) and a message and the server can perform a handshake and perform their relevant task (encoding or decoding).<br>
-**Relevance:** Practice in computer networking and security. This code is meant to display an ability to interface with software and build something that can be safe against networking pitfalls like race conditions while performing it's task. Encoder keys are also a popular method of security right now making this a very relevant example of my experience.<br>

# My Pet Rock: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/My-Pet-Rock<br><br>
-**Description:** A C program that procedurally generates a text-based pet rock and then saves user information for their rock's layout, name, and any stats they might have gained playing with the rock. It's a Tomagachi game made intentionally boring and hard to play but it's still meant to be functional and help me learn some new tasks (random generation in this case).<br>
-**Relevance:** <br>

# Fishin' Hole: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Fishin-Hole<br><br>
-**Description:** A fully functioning Gameboy ROM made using C and the GBDK 2020 libraries that sought to recreate the fictional game "Fishin' Hole" from Stephen King's book, End of Watch. Since it's a Stephen King-themed project I should give a **content warning** for references to suicide <br>
-**Relevance:** Working on the Gameboy requires a lot of pre-planning and organization for code to be traversable and also to not overflow the ROM or RAM banks. Everything must be organized, have a purpose, and it required a lot of time to both learn how to work under these conditions and to get the code to a good stopping point<br>
Everything in this project was made by me except for the music. Both songs were from external sources who I made sure to credit in the description on the Github Repo and on itch.io where I've also posted this project.<br>

# What I couldn't show here
As a student a lot of my much larger projects are classwork that professors don't always let me upload on line since they're technically answers to assignments for future students. A lot of my bigger, cooler group projects aren't allowed to be made public but, rest assured I also have a lot of larger group assignments I work on in my free time including databases and large group HTML projects with unit tests. <br>
I hope to show that I've got a pool of knowledge in a lot of coding languages and good practices. Along with GDBK, I've also made projects in Game Maker, Unreal Engine, and Godot with plans to learn new engines once I wrap up my current project. I've worked in Python, HTML (and friends), C and C++ and I'll keep updating this repo when I've completed something big and cool enough to show off publically.<br>

# What I'm currently working on: 
At the moment I'm working through school assignments. I'm on a year-long capstone project making vehicle simulations in Unreal Engine and Unity Engine (though I'm primarily working in Unreal). The goal is to make something realistic that works with modern racing wheels and libraries so that it's large and modular.<br>
I've been studying the flight behaviors of jet planes and recreating their movement and physics in a program from scratch and helping my group to do the same with a race car. I hope to eventually shar what I'm allowed to on this repository.

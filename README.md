# Portfolio-Hub
Purpose: A hub that contains links and descriptions to some of my choice projects <br><br>

**TODO: **Ensure formatting looks good. Fill out Relevance for almost everything. 
**TODO: ** Avoid fillery words and get to the point more with some of these. After you fill it all out, do a reread to make sure it sounds good
**TODO: ** Get hired

# UNIX Shell: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/UNIX-shell<br><br>
-**Description:** A command-line shell interpreter made in C to run on UNIX operating systems<br>
-**Relevance:** This was a term-long class project where we had to develop on top of existing code to develop a functional UNIX shell. As such, I don't think it displays any efficiency or organizational skills but that I'm capable of working in preexisting large code bases and completing a project. <br>

# Couchlist website:
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Couchlist<br><br>
-**Description:** A website done up to practice basic functions and page navigation in html<br>
-**Relevance:** Couchlist is simple but also technically advanced enough to show I have a decent understanding of coding an html front end for any project that requires it.<br>

# Algorithms:
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Algorithms<br><br>
-**Description:** Some algorithms written in Python. Dijkstra, Travelling salesman, Top down/Bottom up algorithms<br>
-**Relevance:** The goal was to showcase <br>

# Van Scheduler:
https://github.com/charcoalrox/van-schedule-maker<br><br>
-**Description:** A Terminal-based interface that would import external .txt files and then allow users to log into an account and schedule van stops. Written in C<br>
-**Relevance:** <br>

# Client-Server message encoder: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Client-Server-Message-Encoder<br><br>
-**Description:** A series of C programs that can generate a basic encoder key. The other programs allow the user to ping locally hosted encoder and decoder programs to create secret, encrypted messages<br>
-**Relevance:** <br>

# My Pet Rock: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/My-Pet-Rock<br><br>
-**Description:** A fairly small program that procedurally generates text-based rocks and allows the user to name and interact with them in all of the ways you play with a real rock<br>
-**Relevance:** <br>

# Fishin' Hole: 
https://github.com/charcoalrox/Fishin-Hole<br><br>
-**Description:** A fully functioning Gameboy ROM made using C and the GBDK 2020 libraries that sought to recreate the fictional game from Stephen King's End of Watch. As such, Content warning: references to suicide<br>
-**Relevance:** Working on the Gameboy requires a lot of pre-planning and organization for code to be traversable and also to not overflow the ROM or RAM banks. Everything must be organized, have a purpose, and it required a lot of time to both learn how to work under these conditions and to get the code to a good stopping point<br>
Everything in this project was made by me except for the music. Both songs were from external sources who I made sure to credit in the description on the Github Repo and anywhere else I posted it.<br>

# What I couldn't show here
Unfortunately, as a student a lot of my much larger projects weren't given permission to be uploaded to public Github repos so as to avoid uploading answers for future students. As such, I can't prove it with any of my current and available projects but I also have heaps of experience with sql, javascript (including writing unit tests), and some c++.<br>
Along with GDBK, I've also made projects in Game Maker, Unreal Engine, and Godot with plans to learn new engines once I wrap up my current project.

**TODO**: Talk about javascript unit tests, collaberative projects I couldn't mention including the movie store database and also the school database. Maybe add more details to my unreal engine projects. Honestly maybe add Wizard Duel Arena?

# What I'm currently working on: 
At the moment I'm learning gdscript and creating a jrpg game engine in Godot with a focus on ease of use and modulatirt

**TODO:** Expand this section to go into the goals of the project, how it works, and what you hope to do with it
Perhaps allude to future plans as well
